# Reaperi Cycle

A bare illusion of the project source, devoid of images, sounds and life. You might find something useful in the code if you work with the Sega Dreamcast.

This is my attemp at making an engine and a game at the same time. The [guild](http://reapericycle.com) as been working on the game for almost a year now, and I've been messing with DC programming for a bit more than that.

This project is using [kos](https://github.com/ljsebald/KallistiOS) & [kazade's libGL](https://github.com/Kazade/libgl), some base Lua for CSV/XML/JSON parsing, OGGVorbis for sounds. I've also been messing with [dreamroq](https://github.com/multimediamike/dreamroq) with success

Feel free to find me on the [Dreamcast-Talk discord](https://discord.gg/vfWJHS8) if you have any DC related question. I'm not as wise as the one before me, but I'd be happy to help.
